 * below is set, with the mail address from the source
 *
 * If an account already exists with the this mail address and authentication
 * is successful, the anchor and source are added or modified on that account
 * This helps migrating existing SilverStripe users to external authentication
 * sources.
 *
 * If 'setUseAnchor' is set to false (the default) nothing will happen if

 * by the driver and a Silverstripe account is created. If the mail address 
 * used for authentication does not exist and the anchor/source combination is
 * present in the SilverStripe database, that existing account will be used for
 * logon and the user account will be modified with this new mail address.

 * account detail that never changes. The username is thus a bad choice. The 
 * UID or serial of a user account is a better choice. On the other hand, if 
 * setUseAnchor is set to true, the username is the correct choice, since the
 * user is obliged to input that detail when logging on. The user mail address
 * takes over the role of the anchor. If the username and mail address are
 * changed at the same time in the authentication source, the coupled 
 * SilverStripe account will be orphaned.

 * WARNING WARNING WARNING
 * If you do not have control over the external authentication source, you no
 * longer control who can log in. USE WITH CARE
