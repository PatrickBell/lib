# Compass Module

The Compass module for SilverStripe seamlessly integrates Sass and Compass in SilverStripe modules and themes. 
You write your styles in sass, and the module automatically compiles these sass files to css.

## Compass

<cite>
Compass is a stylesheet authoring tool that uses the Sass stylesheet language to make your stylesheets smaller 
and your web site easier to maintain. Compass provides ports of the best of breed css frameworks that you can 
use without forcing you to use their presentational class names. Itâ€™s a new way of thinking about stylesheets 
that must be seen in action!

## Requirements

You need ruby 1.8.6 or better and rubygems 1.2 or better installed on your development system. The module will
download & install all required gems automatically

Normal usage is to commit the built css files to your version control repository during development. This means 
there are no extra software requirements on the live servers.
